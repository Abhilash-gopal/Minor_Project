Implementing Infrastructure as Code with Terraform to Build Kubernetes Infrastructure on    
AWS and Automate Application Deployment Through Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline Using Docker      
and GitHub.         
This project aims to automate the provisioning, deployment, and management of cloud  
infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles. The Kubernetes infrastructure will be  
created on AWS using Terraform, ensuring scalability, reproducibility, and efficient resource  
management. A Jenkins CI/CD pipeline will automate the build, test, and deployment processes,  
integrating Docker for containerization and GitHub for version control. The end-to-end pipeline  
will enable continuous integration and delivery of containerized applications on Kubernetes,  
demonstrating modern DevOps practices and cloud automation techniques.
